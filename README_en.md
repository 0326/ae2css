>**Windows:**  
>`C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Script\`

## Note:
1. This script now can only export **++solid layers,pre-composed layers and image layers++** which has animations on position, rotation, scale, opacity properties. Support parenting and expressions. If the animation is too complex, you'd better export as sprite animation.  
2. Keep the animation short.  

## How to use:
1. In the AE composition, select the layers you're going to export and Mark them.  
2. If the layer is an image layer(png/jpg), or a composition layer that you using as an image, you should click the "Mark CSS" botton.  
3. Check the settings, then click "Export CSS" botton.

## Parameters:

**Timing Fucntion** - Default "steps(1)" means no interpolation between keyframes, which would avoid some bad behaviors in the frame by frame animation. See [ CSS Animation ](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations).  
**Loop** - Loop counts. 0 for infinite loop.  
**Ani Direction** - Play in positive direction or reverse.  
**Fill Mode** - Specifies the behavior for the the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).  
**Name Prefix** - Class name format will be "BX_+prefix+Class+(layer index)". Default is empty.  
**Frame by Frame** - Now only frame by frame mode is supported, other modes are under development.  
**Split CSS File** - Export unique CSS file. You can also warp the CSS codes in the demo HTML file.  

## Sprite Parameters:

**Max Width** - The sprite image would warp to another line if reach this value. The maximum size of The sprite is 30000x30000.  
**Skip Frames** - The more you skip the less size you will get, but the FPS of animation will be lower.  
**Full/WorkArea Length** - When the sprite animation's duration not fit the composition's workarea, the `Full Length` mode will ignore the composition's workarea and keep the sprite full, while the `WorkArea` mode will cut the animation if it expand the workarea.
